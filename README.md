# Recipe-Book
A simple Single Page Application using the framework Angular (specifically Angular 6).  The user can navigate between a list of recipes or a shopping list, which holds ingredients needed for the recipes.  The user must sign-in or register in order to properly edit the details of any one recipe as well as to be able to add a new recipe to the list.

*** This repo only contains the source files for the project but not all other necessary files needed to fully run it as the folders are too large to upload to Github.  What is provided here is the core of the program. ***
